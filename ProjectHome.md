**Zef** is a very lite PHP MVC framework (only 24k) with an extension manager to add and remove helpers easily. I need help to correct and translate english documentation and some help for creating new helpers.

  * To acces the extension manager, go to /system (default password is 'admin')
  * Database is now controlled by PDO.


You can download now a new lightweight version (6k).
